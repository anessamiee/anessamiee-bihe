      <b>Tehran</b> (/tɛəˈræn, -ˈrɑːn, ˌteɪə-/; Persian: تهران‎ Tehrān
      [tehˈɾɒːn]) is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population
      of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the larger
      metropolitan area of Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in
      Iran and Western Asia, and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the
      Middle East, after Cairo). It is ranked 24th in the world by metropolitan
      area population. It is also known for its sprawling development and
      futuristic architecture, epitomized by the Milad Tower and the Fereshteh
      Pasargad Hotel, designed by Zaha Hadid.

      In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was
      occupied by Rhages, a prominent Median city destroyed in the medieval
      Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray is urban area absorbed into
      the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.

      Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of
      the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of its proximity to Iran's territories
      in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to
      avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The
      capital has been moved several times throughout history, and Tehran is the
      32nd national capital of Persia. Large-scale demolition and rebuilding
      began in the 1920s, and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations
      from all over Iran since the 20th century.
