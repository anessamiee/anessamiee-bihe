        <b>Tehran</b> (/tɛəˈræn, -ˈrɑːn, ˌteɪə-/; Persian: تهران‎ Tehrān
        [tehˈɾɒːn]) is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a
        population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the
        larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous
        city in Iran and Western Asia, and has the second-largest metropolitan
        area in the Middle East, after Cairo). It is ranked 24th in the world by
        metropolitan area population. It is also known for its sprawling
        development and futuristic architecture, epitomized by the Milad Tower
        and the Fereshteh Pasargad Hotel, designed by Zaha Hadid.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was
        occupied by Rhages, a prominent Median city destroyed in the medieval
        Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray is urban area absorbed
        into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of
        the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of its proximity to Iran's
        territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the
        Russo-Iranian Wars, to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling
        Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout
        history, and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Persia. Large-scale
        demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s, and Tehran has been a
        destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th
        century.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article "Shemiran-Tehran",
          suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean "the warm place", and "Shemiran"
          means "the cool place". He listed cities with the same base and suffix
          and studied the components of the word in ancient Iranian languages,
          and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing
          in different Iranian language families, as the constant "t" and "k"
          are close to each other in such languages. He also provided evidence
          that cities named "Shemiran" were cold, and those named "Tehran" or
          "Kehran" very hot. He considered other theories not considering
          ancient history of Iranian languages such as "Tirgan" theory and
          "Tahran" theory folk etymology.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that
          settlement in Tehran dates back over 8,000 years.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
          The metropolis of Tehran is divided into 22 municipal districts, each
          with its own administrative center. Of the 22 municipal districts, 20
          are located in Tehran County's Central District, while districts 1 and
          20 are respectively located in the counties of Shemiranat and Ray.
          Although administratively separate, the cities of Ray and Shemiran are
          often considered part of Greater Tehran.

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
          Tehran is the economic centre of Iran. About 30% of Iran's
          public-sector workforce and 45% of its large industrial firms are
          located in the city, and almost half of these workers are employed by
          the government. Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers,
          shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few foreign companies operate in Tehran, due to the government's
          complex international relations. But prior to the 1979 Revolution,
          many foreign companies were active in Iran. Tehran's present-day
          modern industries include the manufacturing of automobiles,
          electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar,
          cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading centre for the
          sale of carpets and furniture. The oil refining companies of Pars Oil,
          Speedy, and Behran are based in Tehran.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis,
          and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The Tehran
          Stock Exchange, which is a full member of the World Federation of
          Exchanges (WFE) and a founding member of the Federation of Euro-Asian
          Stock Exchanges, has been one of the world's best performing stock
          exchanges in recent years.
